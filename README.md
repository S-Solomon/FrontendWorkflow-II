## Basic Support

* Typescript support
* Css
* Sass Support
* React Support
* CSS Frameworks(Styled-components, emotion)

## Hosting

I recommend hosting it on platforms that provides continual integration(CI), the likes of netlify and vercel, so that every time we push, or make a pull request, to the main branch our site automatically updates.
